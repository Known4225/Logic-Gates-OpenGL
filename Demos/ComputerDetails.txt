Specs:
Four 8 bit registers
Sixteen bytes of addressable memory
Program counter - 8 bit incrementor

Instruction Protocol:
00 10 11 01

We have operation, register1, register2, register3
reg1 and reg2 are inputs, reg3 is the output

Operations:
00 - ADD (inp1, inp2, out)
01 - SHIFT (inp1, 00, 00 - shl, 01 - shr)
01 - BEV (inp1, 01, inp2) - branch if even, branches to value of inp2 if inp1 is even
01 - JMP (inp1, 10, 00) - jump to inp1
01 - JMP (00, 10, 01) - jump to 0
10 - SAVE/LOAD (address (3 bits), 0 - save, 1 - load, reg)
11 - BEQ (inp1, inp2, inp3) - inp2 and inp3 are compared, we set the program counter to inp1 if they are equal


Example sequence:
10 000 1 00 - load address 0 into reg0
10 001 1 01 - load address 1 into reg1
00 00 00 11 - add reg0 and reg0 - save in reg3
00 00 01 11 - add reg0 and reg1 - save in reg3
00 01 01 11 - add reg1 amd reg1 - save in reg3
10 010 0 11 - save reg3 to address 2

Prgm1
10 000 1 00 - load address 0 into reg0
10 001 1 01 - load address 1 into reg1
00 00 01 11 - add reg0 and reg1 - save in reg3
10 111 0 11 - save reg3 to address 7
10 001 0 11 - save reg3 to address 1
01 00 10 01 - jump to start


Current problems:
I'm resetting all of my registers every clock cycle. That should only happen if they change. Actually that probably shouldn't happen at all.
 - Could fix it with another round of latches that... wait... no it cant.
 - I should hold the output in the output bus until the last subtick and push it to the latches
